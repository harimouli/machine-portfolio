                Hi! I’m Hari Mouli Muthyala, a prefinal-year Computer Science student at DNR College of Engineering & Technology. I love building things with code — especially when I get to learn something new in the process.

I’m into full-stack web development, and I’ve worked with C++, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, along with tools like TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. I enjoy solving problems and building projects that actually do something useful.
            <br/>
            </p>
            <span className = "text-center  text-md md:text-xl space-y-3 text-slate-100 font-roboto" > Outside of tech, I like playing cricket, solving chess puzzles, and exploring trading and finance. I’m currently looking for an internship or full-time role where I can keep learning and contribute meaningfully. </span>
